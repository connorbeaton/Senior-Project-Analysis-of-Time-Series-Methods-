I followed along someone else's Kaggle notebeook for inspiration, and then branched out to datasets to try and tinker on my own. 
The idea here is to go through a handful of datasets from different contexts and compare whether or not ARIMA models work cleaner than
more modern models, namely LSTM and Prophet.
